# Read Status Management - Functional Description

Track notification read status with optional group propagation and real-time broadcasting.

**Flow**:
1. User reads notification → WebSocket handler
2. Handler loads notification and checks `read_by_all` flag
3. If true: SharedReadService marks all related as READ
4. If false: Mark only this notification as READ
5. Broadcast status update to all connected users in group

**Broadcast Destination**: `/topic/notifications/{userId}/{type}`

**Message Format**:
```json
{
  "eventId": "evt-res-123",
  "status": "READ",
  "readByUser": "John (Staff ID 50)"
}
```

**Transactional**: All operations within @Transactional boundary
