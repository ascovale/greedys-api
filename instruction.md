I have a JSON file generated from SpringDoc for my REST API documentation. In this API, every response is wrapped in a generic class called `ResponseWrapper<T>`, where `T` is the actual data type. This includes cases like:

- `ResponseWrapper<T>` for single objects
- `ResponseWrapper<List<T>>` for lists of objects
- `ResponseWrapper<Page<T>>` for paginated results

However, the JSON schema generated by SpringDoc does not clearly specify the type `T` inside the wrapper, which causes problems when generating Dart models for Flutter using tools like `json_serializable` or `freezed`.

Can you:
1. Inspect the JSON and identify any structural or semantic issues related to the use of `ResponseWrapper<T>`.
2. Suggest how to make the type `T` explicit in the schema so that code generation tools can correctly infer the inner type.
3. Provide guidance or examples on how to restructure or annotate the OpenAPI schema to make it compatible with Dart model generation.

Let me know if you need a sample of the JSON file or a specific endpoint definition.
